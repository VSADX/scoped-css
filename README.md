# Scoped CSS
ðŸŒŒ What is scoped CSS?  
It's a `<style>` element, inside your HTML file.  
  
ðŸŒ„ What does it do?  
Scoped CSS let's you add CSS to a specific group of elements.  
  
ðŸŒ† How does it work?  
The JavaScript library will replace `\&` in your CSS using a unique id for the 
parent HTML element of the `<style>` element.
  
## Examples
See how Scoped CSS works in practice, how we use it, how you may want to use it!
  
1. Here's how you use scoped CSS. Add `class="scoped"` to your `<style>` element.
2. Then use `\&` for all the CSS rules that you want to be scoped.
```html
<div>
  <style class="scoped">
    \& {
      background: lightblue;
    }
    \& p {
      color: navy;
    }
  </style>
  <h2> Hello all! </h2>
  <p> Scoped CSS fits some situations really well. </p>
</div>
```
